# Learn Elixir by fixing test

Inspired by the Ruby Koans, just start running the test files in order by name and fix the tests from top to bottom.

Lot's of the examples are coming from the excellent book by Dave Thomas Programming Elixir, you should get a copy.

## Getting started

Clone the repository in your local machine.
Navigate to the root of the repo and run:

>elixir test/01_pattern_matching_tests.exs

1. Open the file in your editor of choice.
2. Make the changes to the first test to make it pass.
3. Re-run the test from the terminal window.
4. Repite.

Once you are done with file 01 move to file 02 and keep going.

Have fun!
